description: Your troupe has not been travelling for long before you come across a
  shallow but swift river. The path you're on leads directly down to the bank, and
  whilst the river looks passable on foot, you notice the path forks into a rough,
  trodden path leading to a humble stone bridge not far upstream. It seems sensible
  to avoid taking any chances and keep your feet dry, so after a brief discussion
  you decide to lead your troops to the bridge. As you approach, you notice a makeshift
  structure, made primarily of sticks, on the near side of the bridge, and someone
  appears to be standing inside. As you draw nearer you notice the creature is a fairly
  runty troll. Even small trolls are twice the size of an average man, so you cautiously
  make your approach known, which is met with a short, low grunt. Trolls are generally
  not known for their lexical prowess, so you interpret the sound as non-threatening
  and continue your approach. 'Ya go'a pay da toll,' he says, abruptly. After a brief
  stunned silence one of your men retorts; 'a troll toll? Shouldn't you be waiting
  under the bridge? I've never heard tell of a troll that runs a toll bridge, though
  I must admit I rather enjoy the word play.' Looking confused, the troll, still showing
  no sign of aggression, continues; 'Ain't nobody playin' wi' no words 'ere. Ya go'a
  pay da toll to get passed.' More silence. 'A 'undred gold, or a munch yer bones,'
  he adds, picking at his teeth with a crude knife that appears to have once been
  a poor creature's femur. Still dazed, and somewhat perturbed, another of your troupe
  joins the conversation; 'one hundred gold seems reasonable, I guess.' He looks at
  you for direction. You notice many of your troupe are clearly feeling uneasy and
  hands begin to rest on hilts, ready for anything. You ask the troll if he is alone.
  'Yarp, just me.' he says, and continues to stare, vacant yet expectant. Clearing
  your throat, you ask the troll to explain the terms of crossing, and echoing the
  sentiments of your men, mention that you would expect to encounter a troll under
  the bridge, not dealing in the toll business. 'Well, ya see,' he begins, 'a did
  used to live unda dis bridge, and one day a jumps out to eat dis man an shout -
  ARGHH DIS IS A TROLL BRIDGE! A fink he dint 'ere proper an he says - 'ow much is
  da toll? So I stops an says - UM, A 'UNDRED GOLD. He gifs me da gold and jus' walks
  ova da bridge. A know it's not what a troll is 'spose to do, but a thought, dat
  was pretty easy, an a bin doin' it eva since. Dis gold stuff is pretty gud.' He
  stops to shovel a handful of gold pieces into his mouth and crunches loudly. 'A
  'undred gold,' he finishes. You get the feeling you won't get much more out of him
  than that...
