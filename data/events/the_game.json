You take a deep breath and, for that moment, you feel at one with your environment, with the world that, all too often, seems full of woe and violence. In the centre of the clearing is a singular tree, old and magnificent, providing shade and shelter to lively critters that frolic along its branches. Its sturdy trunk stands strong and defiant, a solitary bastion of hope in a world that seems to be forgetting the meaning of the word. Stuck to the trunk, with a rusty knife, is a single piece of parchment with something written on it.
