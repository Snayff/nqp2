description: After camping for the night you awake to find your camp overrun by a
  large knot of toads. You look for any member of your troupe close enough to audibly
  blame for this infestation, before anyone can point out that it was your decision
  to camp so close to a swamp. Thankfully, the toads are quickly overlooked and you
  begin your headcount to set off for the day's march. Amongst your men is one stranger.
  Looking lost and wild-eyed, you noticed he is the spitting image of the man that
  previously tried to tax you for using a fairly sub-par road, though his hair is
  longer and fairer. Perturbed by his presence you aggressively question his attendance.
  'Apologies, sir. I'm simply here to check you have a licence for all these toads
  you're travelling with,' he declares. You laugh, but he stands stoically, awaiting
  your reply. You explain these are simply wild toads from the nearby swamp, and you
  are not travelling with them. 'Look, I'm not judge, jury, and excruciator. I'm just
  here to do my job. Any persons carrying toads, particularly over political borders,
  is subject to a Toad Tax. These fellas can really mess up the ecosystem of a neighbouring
  land, you know!' No one says a word, and this sort of interaction is a little too
  much for you before your morning mug of energy potion. 'A knot this large will cost
  you-' he glances around counting silently, '50 gold. You know what they say - if
  you bring your toads across the land, you must pay the fee on demand.' He holds
  up a tattered parchment, on which is written only the limerick he just recited and
  a rather detailed sketch of a personified toad giving a thumbs up...
