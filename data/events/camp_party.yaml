description: You wake in the early hours of the morning to hear a lot of commotion
  in your camp. Hesitantly, you peek out of your tent to see what is happening without
  revealing to the world your favourite night wear, embarrassingly hand stitched with
  the words 'Lurent is my spirit animal' in elegant cursive. The commotion continues
  to swell with laughter and cheering, the smell of beer fills the air and a particularly
  rowdy looking crowd are tucking into tomorrow's rations. You quickly realise that
  your troops are having a party, complete with blackjack and hookers. Everyone looks
  and sounds happy. Past and future troubles are not being dwelt on and, morbidly,
  some of these men are currently enjoying what might be their last night among the
  living. Shutting down the party may be the sensible thing to do, but will likely
  not be received well by the men. Alternatively, joining in sounds like fun, but
  you may have to march into battle with a bunch of hungover zombies tomorrow...
