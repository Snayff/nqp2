description: Your journey leads you through a beautiful clearing in the midst of a
  dense forest. The sun is shining down on you and your troupe, causing the grass
  and surrounding shrubbery, still damp with the morning dew, to glisten as it dances
  in the breeze. You take a deep breath and, for that moment, you feel at one with
  your environment, with the world that, all too often, seems full of woe and violence.
  In the centre of the clearing is a singular tree, old and magnificent, providing
  shade and shelter to lively critters that frolic along its branches. Its sturdy
  trunk stands strong and defiant, a solitary bastion of hope in a world that seems
  to be forgetting the meaning of the word. Stuck to the trunk, with a rusty knife,
  is a single piece of parchment with something written on it. You approach to read
  the words of wisdom left by another clearly inspired by the beauty of this place.
  It reads; 'YOU LOST THE GAME...'
