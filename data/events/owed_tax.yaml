description: As you approach the end of a long day's travel, the dusk provides a serene
  setting that lightens your heart. One day closer to your journey's goal. While setting
  up camp you hear faint shouting over the hills in the direction from which you came.
  You cannot see the source of the shouting, but it gradually gets louder until an
  exhausted man appears on the closest hilltop. He looks suspiciously like a man about
  to charge you a settlement tax or something equally nonsensical. When he finally
  reaches your troupe he takes a frustratingly long time to catch his breath. He has
  clearly been trying to catch up with you for a while. Seemingly aware of the awkward
  silence, he begins to address you between gasps of breath. 'Ever... so... sorry
  to... bother... you... my lord,' he begins. You instinctively reach for your gold
  pouch, awaiting the inevitable. 'I am... the... local... representative... from,'
  he begins to finally catch his breath, 'her late majesty's revenue and customs...
  It has come to our attention that you have been the victim of some fraudulent tax
  scams. You really shouldn't trust the word of deranged strangers, sir. Unfortunately,
  we cannot refund the full potential amount of the scams, but the HLMRC have seen
  fit to provide you with some compensation for your trouble.' He hands over a bag
  of coins. 'Please be more wary of tricksters and fiends in future. Good day!' Before
  you can answer he sets off running again in the direction you were travelling, and
  promptly begins shouting ahead as if attempting to flag down another gullible soul...
