description: It's a fine day. You breathe in the fresh, morning air as you and your
  troupe march along the road. Your mind wanders, dwelling optimistically on your
  goal of power and glory. Abruptly, your daydream shatters as a frantic man scrambles
  towards you, yelling unintelligibly. He is fairly well dressed, but looks dishevelled.
  'Um, have you paid your road tax, sir?' he questions. Clearly sensing your confusion,
  he continues, 'premium roads like this aren't free you know... ribbit.' Again, you
  say nothing, choosing to ignore his amphibian vocalisation. You have never heard
  of such a tax before. 'Anyone with a roadworthy troupe is required to pay the new
  road tax, payable to the Commander and Troupe Licencing Agency. CTLA for short.
  Without a tax discus you could be fined up to 10 gold for every foot under your
  command,' he proclaims. You begin your protest but he quickly cuts you off, looking
  around agitatedly. '100 gold and you can be on your way with your brand new, official
  documentation.' He retrieves something from his pocket and holds up a round piece
  of paper with a handwritten note. As he does this, you notice a small toad fall
  from his pocket and quickly hop away. The documentation does not look very official...
