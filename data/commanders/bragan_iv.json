    "backstory": "The Noble's Son. Bragan IV is bratty and incompetent, but money talks so he doesn't have to. With no discernible skills or talents, he'll spend as much of daddy's money as needed to claim a land of his own. Maybe then daddy will love him! (Trait) He has no idea how to train an army. All training is less effective, but a weekly gold allowance should make up for that. Why train them, when you can replace them?",
