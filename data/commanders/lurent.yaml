backstory: The Inspiring Leader. Lurent is compassionate, respected, and often refers
  to herself as an 'influencer' which is met with frequent eye rolling amongst her
  fellow commanders. Her soldiers are loyal followers and proud to dub themselves
  'Lurentites', ready and willing to fight for her honour, even to their very last
  breath if necessary. (Trait) Her inspiring presence grants more morale, and all
  units have increased health.
