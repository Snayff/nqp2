PyInstaller is used to package NQP2 for Windows/Linux.

The command should be the following:
<whatever your python command is> -m PyInstaller nqp2.py --noconsole

This should create a dist and build folder. Inside dist/nqp2, there should be a nqp2.exe.

Run the executable from the command line to see errors if the executable crashes. Running the packaging command on Windows will create a Windows executable while running it on Linux will create a Linux executable. PyInstaller is known to be finnicky on MacOS, so you may want to use other packaging software to package for MacOS.

Please note that nqp2.py may need to be updated to import libraries that PyInstaller misses.

Note from Fluffy:
I don't have any devices with MacOS, so I cannot test packaging for MacOS.
